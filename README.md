# Input Initial data
  Descisions:  1. should the program input a map of data or a profile?
               2. use UTM coordinates for modelling so should the data be in that format initially or should we convert on the fly?
               3. Input geology at the same time?
               4. Do the gravity and magnetic points have to be in the same positions (initially, I think not but the coordinate for the model must match)
